Cryptos
================================
Very Unfinished CryptoCurrency dashboard. Still in Pre Alpha

A rails based application meant to allow a user to see his or her CryptoCurrency related investments over time in one place instead of having to navigate to various websites. It currently fetches information by the API's provided by bitfunder, BTCT, and BTC-E and stores them in a database within the rails framework.

Getting Started
-------------------------
Clone the git repository to a local folder
Run the following from inside the folder
	rails s
	sidekiq

Delete the user hak8or from localhost:3000/user_infos and put in your information

Go to localhost:3000 to view your CryptoCurrency information
